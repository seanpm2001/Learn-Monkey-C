# About:
# I decided to make Monkey-C the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Monkey-C) as Monkey-C is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Monkey-C programming language. It only makes sense to Monkey-C the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
